# Procedure

### Basic Knowledge - 
- Answer all the questions and click on "Submit Test" button
- Click on "Next level"

### Construction of Wheatstone bridge:-
- Click on a component from the left panel to select it. The selected component will appear on the right, where you can drag and drop the component to adjust its position
- You can select any image or connection and click the delete button to modify it, if needed
- Use drag-and-drop to connect the ports and construct the Wheatstone bridge
- After making the connections, click the "Validate Connection" button to verify them. If the connections are incorrect three times, a popup message will appear, and on the fourth attempt, a hint will be provided. If the connections are correct, you will be redirected to the next page 

### Standard Calculation:-

- Select pressure range between 0.001 to 0.1 torr  
- After submitting pressure another panel will appear where you have to enter temperature. Here temperature range is between 50 to 60 degree K  
- After submitting the temperature, calculate value of Rx. Once the value of Rx is submitted successfully, another panel will appear where you have to calculate output voltage Vout (mV) 
- After click on "Submit", click on "Next Reading" and repeat the procedure. This part shows standard calculated values
- After 5 iterations click on "Next Level" button

### Actual Calculation:-
- Enter pressure range between 0.001 to 0.1 torr  
- After submitting pressure another panel will appear where you have to enter temperature. Here temperature range is between 50 to 60 degree K, Here the actual values of Rx will be displayed
- Click on "Submit", Here the actual values of output voltage can be observed 
- Click on "Next Reading". Observe the same for other values

### Observation:-
- Observe the difference between standard value and actual value and on "Next Level" button on the top

### Calibration:-
- Calculate zero error (zero error = actual reading - observed reading)
- Calculate span error (span error = actual reading - observed reading)
- Observe the graph and then adjust zero point on the graph by click on "plus" and "minus" buttons 
- Once zero error is calibrated then calibrate span error with same process 
- When span error is calibrated it disturbs zero. Again zero is adjusted
