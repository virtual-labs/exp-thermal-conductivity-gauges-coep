# Procedure

### Prerequisite - 
- Answer all the questions and click on "Submit Test" button.
- Click on Next level.

 ### Simulator:-

Part-I :
1. Enter Pressure Range between 0.001 to 0.1 torr.  
2. After pressure submission another pannel will appear where you have to enter temperature. Here temperature range is between 50 to 60 degree K.  
3. After submitting the temperature, Calculate value of Rx. Once the value of Rx is submitted successfully, another pannel will appear where you have to calculate output voltage Vout (mV). 
4. After click on submit, Click on Next Reading and repeat the procedure. This part shows standard Calculated values.
5. After 5 iterations click on Next Level button.

Part-II :
1. Enter Pressure Range between 0.001 to 0.1 torr.  
2. After pressure submission another pannel will appear where you have to enter temperature. Here temperature range is between 50 to 60 degree K, Here the actual values of Rx will be displayed.
3. Click on Submit, Here the actual values of Output voltage can be observed. 
4. Click on Next Reading. Observe the same for other values.
